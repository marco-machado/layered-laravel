# Layered Laravel

## Introduction
This is a simple Laravel project that demonstrates the use of layered architecture in Laravel. The project is divided into four layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer (Controllers/Views)
- First point of contact with external requests
- Handles HTTP requests and responses
- Performs basic input validation
- Controls the flow of data presentation
- Manages route handling
- Returns views or API responses
- Should be thin - no business logic
- Acts as a traffic controller, directing requests to appropriate services

### 2. Service Layer
- Heart of the application - contains all business logic
- Orchestrates the workflow between repositories
- Implements business rules and validations
- Handles complex operations involving multiple repositories
- Manages transactions
- Processes data before and after storage
- Independent of HTTP layer
- Can be reused across different parts of application
- Ensures business rules are centralized and consistent

### 3. Repository Layer
- Abstracts data persistence logic
- Provides clean interface for database operations
- Makes application database-agnostic
- Handles all CRUD operations
- Encapsulates query logic
- Allows easy switching between data storage types
- No business logic - purely data access
- Can implement caching strategies
- Makes testing easier through interfaces

### 4. Data Layer (Models/Database)
- Represents database tables as objects
- Defines relationships between entities
- Manages database schema
- Handles basic data validation
- Contains database migrations
- Defines table structure and relationships
- Lowest level of the application
- Pure data representation without business logic

## Benefits of N-Layer Architecture
1. **Separation of Concerns**
    - Each layer has specific responsibilities
    - Code is more organized and focused

2. **Maintainability**
    - Easier to modify individual layers
    - Changes don't ripple through entire application

3. **Testability**
    - Layers can be tested independently
    - Easier to mock dependencies

4. **Scalability**
    - Layers can be scaled independently
    - Easy to modify implementation details

5. **Security**
    - Business logic is protected in service layer
    - Data access is controlled through repositories

6. **Reusability**
    - Services and repositories can be reused
    - Code duplication is minimized

## Data Flow
1. Client request → Presentation Layer
2. Presentation → Service Layer
3. Service → Repository Layer
4. Repository → Data Layer
5. Response flows back up through layers used by the services.
